# General:

### Q) If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?

- redo the test configuration because I had problems updating the components snapshots;
- add design for larger screens;
- implement an authentication system;
- implement a filter system and a search function to better navigate the list of works;
- dockerize everything for better development experience and deployment;
- add more unit and e2e tests;

### Q) Which parts are you most proud of? And why?

I like working on the store using Redux, I find it a good way to separate the logic layer from the UI.
This way I can focus on testing and implementing the business logic (for example the choice of tag to display) and then I can start working on the UI.
I think my implementation of the store is very clean and ready to be expanded and tested. The configuration of the store allow for multiple slices of the store to be added both in terms of entities and in terms of logic (authentication for example).

### Q) Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?

Definitely the UI. My last position was very managerial and focused on code reviews, testing and node.js code so at this point I haven't written a single line of css for almost a year, I need some time to get back to it, hopefully you will forgive my poor css

### Q) How did you find the test overall? Did you have any issues or have difficulties completing?If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test, we'd love to hear them.

I liked the fact that is very open in the way someone can do it, if I can suggest something is to let the developer start the project from scratch in order to have a cleaner starting configuration.
